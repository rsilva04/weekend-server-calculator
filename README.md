# Project Name

Create an HTML file (e.g., index.html) with the necessary elements:
Two input elements to allow the user to input numerical values for operands.
A dropdown (select) element to let the user choose the mathematical operation (e.g., Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division).
A "Submit" button to trigger the calculation.
A "C" button to clear the input fields.
A container to display the result of the calculation.
Step 2: Capture User Input

Use JavaScript to handle the click event of the "Submit" button.
Inside the event handler, get the values entered by the user from the input elements.
Get the selected operation from the dropdown.
Step 3: Bundle Input in an Object and Send via POST

Create a JavaScript object containing the user input values (operands) and the selected operation.
Use the Fetch API or XMLHttpRequest to send this object to the server via a POST request.
Step 4: Server-side Logic (Node.js with Express)
